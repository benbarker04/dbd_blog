I personally, do not get the hype for the amount of them. If they felt luxurious and in special moments, like during a mori, for example, sure, it would be rare and it would be fine for me.As Lara Croft is now the most recent addition, I'll use her as an example, of why I want this. I have liked Lara Croft as a character for many years through her own games and movies, so I was excited to play as her, but hearing 'Oh, No', 'Bollocks'. 'No, no, no' EVERY. SINGLE. TIME a chase starts, gets super annoying after like 3 games and I never want to touch that character ever again.If voice lines is the future and almost every character will have them, please for the love that's all holy, add an option to not have them on at all times.</p>",
